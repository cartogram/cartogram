Our Pandemic Project. My creative and life partner Fiona and I started Pawzzles in 2020 as a <a href="/fondfolio">Fondfolio</a> spin-off product, turning the otherwise wasted wood off-cuts into a fun game for cats. Pawzzles helps divert your cats (sometimes) distracting energy and engages their natural hunting instincts. These also look pretty (for pet toys) and are sold online with profits donated to a local cat rescue.
