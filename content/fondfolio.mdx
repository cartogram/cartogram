Fondfolio is a self-funded venture between myself and my partner. We sell handmade, physical gift books for special occasions where the contents are contributed by the recipientsâ€™ friends and family. During the pandemic we created a spin-off product, <a href="/pawzzles">Pawzzles</a>, turning the otherwise wasted off-cuts into a fun game for cats. These are sold online with profits donated to a local cat rescue.
